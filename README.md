## Hangman

This is a command line version of the Hangman game. There is a Hangman class, that has a dictionary of words for the game. Maybe in the future we can use the 10,000 most common English words to make the game even more interesting. Otherwise the Hangman class has lots of methods to keep track of the number of attempts, the attempted characters, and whether the game is over. Overall it was a fun exercise in object-oriented programming. There are also tests.

clone, `bundle`, and have fun with `ruby path/to/lib/play_hangman.rb`!
